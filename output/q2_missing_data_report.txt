Missing Value Summary:
- Total missing values: 323
- Percentage of missing data: 96.42%
In total, there were 323 missing values in the data, 
which is approximately 96.42% of the entire dataset. 
Since the data is taken monthly, there are missing values in all of the data except once a month,
on the last day of each month. This is a lot of missing data. In order to fill the missing values,
I used several imputation methods including forward fill, backward fill, interpolation, and rolling mean.
The forward fill method uses the last filled value to fill the missing value that comes after it,
or it propagates the last valid observation forward. This is useful when we assume
that the last known value is a reasonable estimate for the missing data.
Backward fill works very similarly to forward fill but in the opposite direction, 
filling missing values with the next valid observation.
Interpolation estimates missing values based on surrounding data points, 
which can capture trends in the data pretty effectively.
The rolling mean method smooths the data by averaging over a specified window,
which can help reduce noise and provide a more stable estimate for missing values.
Rationale:
I chose these methods because they are commonly used for analysis and can effectively handle different patterns of missing data.
Pros and Cons:
- Forward and backward fill are very simple and fast but these methods may not capture the trends in the data.
- Interpolation is better at reflecting trends in the data, but it may introduce bias if the data is not linear.
- Rolling mean smooths the data but may lag behind actual values and can obscure short-term fluctuations.
For example this is the data with many missing values: 
date
2023-01-31    98.777000
2023-02-01          NaN
2023-02-02          NaN
2023-02-03          NaN
2023-02-04          NaN
                ...    
2023-12-27          NaN
2023-12-28          NaN
2023-12-29          NaN
2023-12-30          NaN
2023-12-31    98.538865
Freq: D, Name: temperature, Length: 335, dtype: float64. 

In the data, only the last days of the month
have values for the temperature. If we use time based interpolation, we will fill the missing values in.
