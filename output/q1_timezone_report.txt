 
1. Original timezone: The timezone of the original data is naive, 
    as it was not indicated anywhere in the dataset. Thus, we do not know what the original timezone was.
2. Localization method: To localize the data, I used tz_localize("UTC") 
    to make the base timezone the UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) timezone.
3. Conversion: I converted the timezone from UTC to Eastern time (EST) using tz_convert("US/Eastern").
4. DST handling: Daylight Saving Time (DST) can cause ambiguity when converting between timezones, 
    which is why we want to use UTC since it avoids DST issues. Storing the data in UTC ensures that there is no
    ambiguity when converting to local timezones. WE will only convert to local timezones for display or analysis purposes.
    By making sure the data is in UTC timezone, we can make the data even more reliable and consistent.
5. Example: For example, a datetime of 11am on March 12, 2023 in UTC time would be '2023-03-12 11:00:00' in UTC. 
    In eastern time, this would be 5 am EST on March 12, 2023, which is 5 hours behind the coordinated universal time.
    In datetime format, this converts to '2023-03-12 06:00:00' in Eastern time (EST) before the DST transition.
